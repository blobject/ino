"cmp" = implemented fully (per designer's whim; not final)
"prt" = implemented partially
"add" = modified with additions
"fix" = modified to eliminate error
"imp" = modified as improvement
" * " = non-design, holistic, or miscellaneous update

000:
- [*] 16 aug 2021:
  - Decide to do an original design. Serifed, like Courier, with smaller x-height, thicker strokes, more deliberate serifs, and prettier shapes.
- [*] 17 oct 2020:
  - See DPDHL's Delivery font https://www.dpdhl-brands.com/dhl/en/guides/design-basics/typography/typography.html. Consider adapting it to monospace.
- [*] 31 aug 2019:
  - Stumble upon https://github.com/hatsumatsu/Lab-Mono which looks pretty much exactly like what I wanted to make (ie. Apercu Mono).
  - Decide to fallback to secondary design idea. (Which is what?)
- [*] 15 nov 2018:
  - Decide to use metapost for consistent, assured, and (hopefully) faster glyph generation.
  - Start studying metafont and metapost. Feeding metapost's result into fontforge could be scripted, so only the source and feed code need to be published.
- [*] 25 sep 2018:
  - Find out the font I had encountered is Apercu Mono.
  - Decide to go ahead with design of Ino, a lookalike but with some glyphs tweaked and accompanied by different styles and weights.
  - Decide to closely study Apercu, Circular, Akkurat Mono, and Replica Mono.
- [*] 18 sep 2018:
  - Name it "Ino", Agave and Autonoe's sister. Will be a learning project, as a continuation of Agave.
  - Start closely studying Futura and similar geometric sans-serifs.
- [*] summer 2018:
  - See Norwegian Air's "n" in-flight magazine and fall in love with its go-to monospace. Cannot figure out the name of the face.
  - Decide to make a face that resembles above.
  - Love the "l", "o", "s", "t", "n", x-height. But want to improve on "j", width, bearing. Really want to implement italic and bold.
  - Want to abide by geometric simplicity and coding friendliness.
